# The Checklist

Please view this list in raw code, otherwise "+" and "-" that I used for the checklist won't render properly

## Main stuff:
+ DESK switch
+ ONAIR switch
+ hass calls for light DESK and ONAIR signs
+ MUTEALL switch 
+ MICSELECT switch
+ discord mode 3pos switch
+ discord leave call/start stream push button
+ CLIP moment push button
+ REC-ording toggle button (needs code)
+ REC-ording light (need to add a MOSFET)
+ PC PWR button and light (mobo - jst side only)

## Quality of Life:
- make a back cover
- add colored labels to submodules

## Post production:
- upload CAD files of modules
- write docs for voicemeeter + discord bindings

- write a dev blog post (maybe)

## Plans & Ideas for V2:
- redo screws + nuts that connect modules
- move recording button up - its nut gets in the way when inserting the submodule
- add led indicators for button/switch states
- move the jst connectors
- make an app to generate python code (maybe)
- OLED screen
- redo the perfboard mounting holes, currently mounted on 2/4 as only two align at a time
- redo all the screws in the modules, bottom screws in the control module are literally a nightmare, screwing modules together is as well. maybe add a place to push the nuts into before the screws?
- make it disable storage when connecting and have it be reenable-able when shorting GP1 and GND to edit code
- refactor
